# The AI Revolution: Friend or Foe?

We're living in exciting times! The world is undergoing another industrial revolution and this time, it's all about artificial intelligence. ðŸ¤–

The first industrial revolution said goodbye to manual labor and introduced machines. Then, the second industrial revolution introduced new scientific technologies, mass production, and industrialization. After that was the digital revolution where the internet and online communication changed the world as we know it. And now, the fourth revolution has begun â€“ the AI revolution.

It's impossible to predict what this will exactly look like. However, one long term fact seems to be clear. Eventually, there will be AI agents that: 
- Consume information at lightning speed, 
- make intelligent decisions, 
- take digital actions (anything on a computer), 
- communicate with other agents 
Hmmm... An intelligent being capable of communicating, cooperating and taking actions in it's environment. Where have I heard that before

However, while I believe it to be a fundamental truth that one day human intelligence will be obsolete, I have 0% idea what will happen between now and then. Let's not forget that AI was created by humans [CHANGE FROM HERE, mention alignment and how businesses will dramaticaly drive AI use and the invisible hand of society will ultimately create it and emergent behaviour etc)] it's up to us to make sure it's used ethically and responsibly. 

Something here about emergent behaviour (e.g. agents making other agents, digital agent hangouts, the digital ecosystem, agents trying to get into physical bodies! That's such a cool short story.)

Another thing is timelines are increasingly fast. When chatGPT dropped, I got scared. Then a few months passed and another more powerful model integrated with Bing and twitter got scared again. Now Google is competing too and the arms race begins. So I'm writing this to try and clear it out of my mental space.

In the meantime, let's enjoy the benefits of AI. It has already empowered us in so many ways â€“ we can write, code, create music, and
