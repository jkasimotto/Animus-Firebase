# Website Specification
## Header
A circular image should be displayed in the top-left of the header.
When the circular image is clicked, a random image from the src/images folder should be displayed.
The header should contain links to the following pages: Home, About, Articles.
The links should have even spacing between them and should not take up the entire width of the header.
The circular image should be centered both horizontally and vertically within the parent container.
The circular image should be larger, however still responsive to the size of the screen.
## Left Sidebar
A sidebar should be implemented on the left side of the page.
The width of the sidebar should be the same as the width of the div containing the circular image in the header.
The sidebar will be implemented in a later phase and its functionality is yet to be determined.
The sidebar should be designed to be responsive and should adjust its width accordingly on different screen sizes.
The sidebar should not overlap the header when the view width is above a certain threshold.
## Additional Notes
The images in the src/images folder should be preloaded for optimal performance.
The circular image in the header should be implemented using CSS and should not be an actual image file.
The links in the header should be functional and should redirect the user to the corresponding page.
CSS should be created for all elements on the page.
The website should have 3 pages: Home, About, and Articles, each page should have its own component and css.
The routing should be handled by the React Router library, to show the appropriate component based on the current URL.
The website should be built with React.js and the css should be scoped to the component level by using css modules.
Please note that this is just an example, you will need to adjust it to your project structure and requirements.
